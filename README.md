# TaskerWebsite
This is a website that i have built For my Uviversity project as a final submission i used alot of diffrent Tools to make this website like PHP, SQL, HTML. 
this is a website that I have made for my second year final submission project, the concept for this website was something similar to you Uber, the way this website works is done if for example somebody has a job to do around their house they can make a post uploaded onto the website and that will be displayed on the main dashboard to all the users available if a user decides to take that job will be able to accept the job communicate with the person who posted that job go to the house get the work done and get paid. to be able to use this website you going to have to download Xammp or convert these files to HTML files.
